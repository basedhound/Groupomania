## <br /> <a name="tech-stack">‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack</a>

- [**React**](https://react.dev/reference/react) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes over time. React's component-based architecture allows developers to create reusable UI components, making development more efficient and the codebase easier to maintain. 

- [**Axios**](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from a web browser or Node.js. It provides a simple and intuitive API for sending asynchronous requests to servers and handling responses. Axios supports features like request and response interception, automatic JSON data transformation, and request cancellation, making it a powerful tool for managing API interactions and handling HTTP communications in web applications.

- [**Mantine UI**](https://mantine.dev/getting-started/) is a modern React component library that provides a set of high-quality, customizable components and hooks for building user interfaces. Mantine UI is designed to be easy to use, with a focus on flexibility and accessibility. It includes components such as buttons, modals, and forms, as well as theming support, responsive design utilities, and built-in hooks for managing state and effects. It aims to streamline the development process and enhance the overall user experience with a consistent and attractive design.

- [**REST API**](https://blog.postman.com/rest-api-examples/) (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a specific type of API that adheres to the principles of REST, an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources, which are typically represented in JSON or XML format. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. This approach simplifies the interactions between client and server and ensures scalability and performance.

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript on the server side, enabling the creation of scalable and high-performance applications. Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it particularly suitable for building real-time, data-intensive applications.

- [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of creating RESTful APIs by providing a thin layer of fundamental web application features, including routing, middleware support, and HTTP utilities.

- [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/) is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is designed for scalability and high performance, making it suitable for applications that handle large volumes of data. MongoDB's document model allows for easy data manipulation and querying, providing a more natural way to work with data compared to traditional relational databases.

- [**Mongoose**](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution to model application data, ensuring data consistency and providing powerful tools for querying and validation. Mongoose simplifies the process of interacting with MongoDB by providing a higher abstraction layer.

- [**NPM**](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager) (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to install, share, and manage dependencies in their projects. NPM provides access to a vast repository of open-source packages, facilitating the rapid development and integration of new features.

- [**Bcrypt**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) is a library for hashing passwords in a secure manner. It uses a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks and employs a computationally intensive hashing algorithm, making brute-force attacks impractical. Bcrypt ensures that passwords are stored securely, enhancing the overall security of an application.

- [**Crypto-js**](https://cryptojs.gitbook.io/docs) is a cryptography library in JavaScript that provides various cryptographic algorithms, such as hashing, encryption, and decryption. It is used to secure data, ensuring its integrity and confidentiality. Crypto-js is commonly used for encrypting sensitive information before storing or transmitting it.

- [**Dotenv**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is a module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. This practice helps manage configuration and secrets in Node.js applications, keeping them out of the source code and making it easier to change settings without modifying the application code.

- [**Helmet**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) is a middleware for Express applications that helps secure apps by setting various HTTP headers. It mitigates common web vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other web attacks by configuring appropriate security-related HTTP headers.

- [**Jsonwebtoken**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications, allowing secure and verifiable transfer of information. JWTs are often used for implementing stateless authentication mechanisms.

- [**Mongoose-unique-validator**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-unique-validator) is a plugin for Mongoose that adds pre-save validation for unique fields within a Mongoose schema. It simplifies the enforcement of uniqueness constraints in MongoDB documents, ensuring that certain fields, such as usernames or email addresses, remain unique.

- [**Multer**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. It simplifies the process of handling file uploads in an Express application by providing various options for storage and file handling, making it easy to manage file uploads.

- [**Password-validator**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/password-validator) is a library for validating password strength and compliance with defined rules. It helps enforce security policies by ensuring passwords meet specific criteria, such as length, complexity, and character variety. This enhances the security of user accounts by promoting the use of strong passwords.

- [**Validator**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) is a library for string validation and sanitization. It provides a set of functions for validating and sanitizing strings, helping ensure data integrity and security in web applications. Validator is commonly used for validating user input, ensuring that it meets the expected format and constraints.

<br/>**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone {git remote URL}
```

<br/>**Installation**

Let's install the project dependencies for both the client and server, from your terminal, run:

```bash
# Navigate to the client directory
cd client

# Install the necessary dependencies for the client-side application
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
# or
yarn install --legacy-peer-deps

# Navigate back to the root directory
cd ..

# Navigate to the server directory
cd api

# Install the necessary dependencies for the server-side application
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

<br/>**Set Up Environment Variables**

1. Create a new file named `.env` inside the client folder and add the following content:

```env
# Must write "REACT_APP" or it won't work
REACT_APP_PUBLIC_FOLDER = http://localhost:5000/images/
```

2. Create a new file named `.env` inside the api folder and add the following content:

```env
PORT=5000

MONGO_URI=
